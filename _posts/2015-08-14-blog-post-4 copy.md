Ye Meri Ghazalein, Ye Meri Nazmein by Ahmad Faraz has been a deeply enriching read. The collection of his poetry captures a wide range of emotions—love, loss, yearning, and reflection—in a way that’s both profound and accessible. Faraz’s words often feel like they’re coming from a place of personal experience, but they’re also universal enough to resonate with anyone who’s felt the weight of love or heartbreak. His ability to express complex feelings with simplicity and grace is something I really admire.

One of the most favorite ghazal is : 

रंग थे जो कभी चेहरे पे, उनका क्या हुआ।
अब के हमने जो कहा, सुन के क्या हुआ ।।

In this verse, Faraz perfectly captures the transient nature of emotions, how things that once brought joy and color to life can fade away, leaving behind only memories and unspoken words. There’s a bittersweetness to this, which is a recurring theme in many of his works. His poetry often makes me pause and reflect on how fleeting yet meaningful certain moments can be.

Each ghazal and nazm in this collection offers something to ponder, whether it’s about personal identity, the pain of separation, or the hope for a better tomorrow. For anyone who enjoys reflective and introspective poetry, this book is a gem.
