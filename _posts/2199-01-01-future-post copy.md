Ikigai The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles has been one of the most refreshing and insightful reads so far this year. The book introduces me to the concept of ikigai, a Japanese term that roughly translates to "a reason for being." This concept focuses on finding purpose and meaning in life, which I found both intriguing and relatable.

The authors explore how embracing the philosophy of ikigai can lead to a more fulfilling and long life. They make it clear that living with purpose isn’t just a lofty idea, but a practical approach to well-being and longevity.

Much of the inspiration for the book comes from Okinawa, a region known for its high number of centenarians. I was fascinated to learn about the lifestyle habits of the people there. These habits, it turns out, are simple yet powerful choices that contribute to their health and happiness over the years.

The authors dive into these habits in detail, connecting them to the concept of ikigai and showing how small changes in daily life can create a significant impact on overall well-being. It’s not about extreme practices, but about living with intention and balance.
