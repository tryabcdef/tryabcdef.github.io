Some of the major software development lifecycle models are:

* <b>Iterative Model :</b> The Iterative Model in software development focuses on developing and deploying one feature at a time, repeating the same series of activities through multiple cycles. This repetition allows for refining and improving the product with each iteration, making it suitable for projects that benefit from gradual enhancements.

* <b> Incremental Model :</b> The Incremental Model emphasizes the modular development of software, where features are built and deployed incrementally. A clear modular architecture is essential for this model, as each new feature is added as an extension of the previous ones, ensuring steady progress and functionality with every iteration.

* <b>Agile Model :</b> The Agile Model is characterized by simultaneous development and coding activities. It places significant importance on collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability. Agile encourages iterative and incremental delivery, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver value to stakeholders at every stage.

* <b> Spiral Model :</b> The Spiral Model combines iterative development with risk analysis, making it a preferred choice for complex and high-risk projects. Each cycle involves thorough planning, risk resolution, development, and evaluation. However, the model can be expensive and challenging to manage due to its focus on comprehensive risk management.

* <b> Waterfall Model :</b> The Waterfall Model follows a linear and sequential approach where all requirements are collected upfront, and each phase is completed before moving to the next. It is simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for smaller projects with well-defined requirements and minimal scope for changes.

* <b>V-Model :</b> The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation Model, ensures that the developed software meets business requirements through rigorous testing aligned with each development stage. This model emphasizes verifying and validating requirements at every phase to deliver a product that satisfies all defined objectives.


<b>Some other type of Development Models are: </b>

* <b>Prototype Model : </b> The Prototype Model is centered around creating a working prototype to gather feedback and refine requirements before developing the final system. This model is highly effective in projects where user needs are unclear or evolving, as it allows stakeholders to visualize functionalities and provide input early in the development process.

* <b>Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model : </b>The Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model prioritizes speed and flexibility by focusing on rapid prototyping and iterative development. It involves active user participation and relies on reusable components, which enables faster delivery of high-quality systems. This model is ideal for projects requiring quick turnaround times and frequent updates based on user feedback.
